The figure above shows diagram of a bicycle model or a single track model.

Base on this figure and its shown vectors such as velocity, sideslip angle, slip angles in the front and rear, lateral forces, and steering angle, the model formulation will be derived.

First of all, let's derive the **slip angle formulations in the front and rear**:
